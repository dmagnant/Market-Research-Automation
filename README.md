# Market-Research

Problem: I participate in sites that I generally refer to as "Market Research" because they offer small rewards for surveys, tasks, logins etc. Some of them are also referred to as "Get-Paid-To" or GPT sites for short. The tasks and surveys are sometimes engaging, but often times the tasks were reptitive and time-consuming.

Solution: I decided to automate several of these tasks utilizing Python and Selenium so that I could earn rewards without some of the hassle.
